# Writing Code

Welcome to the Code section of the Dev Playbook! Let's talk about writing code.

This section aims to arm you with the knowledge you need to succeed in the work in which we have full (or _nearly_ full) control over. Most of the time you'll hear these referred to as our _projects_ (as opposed to _products_, which are our retainer-based clients).

This documentation exists because we want you to be able to move easily in and out of any project, and we want you to have fun while you're writing code!

To accomplish this, we keep two ideas top of mind, above all else:

1. **Convention over configuration.** There is a lot of process baked in here, especially for an organization as small as we are. That's intentional. By taking the time and giving the care to our process, we make life better for all of us. It's important to first learn our conventions, and then poke holes in them to help refine and strengthen them over time.
1. **Write for someone else.** When you write code, write it like some else is going to read it. Like someone else is going to maintain it. Make it semantic. Choose good names. Use comments where it could help support readability. Leave yourself a paper trail to be proud of.

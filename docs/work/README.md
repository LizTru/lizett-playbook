# Welcome to the party, nerds

You are now a member of a fast-growing technology-focused digital agency who's mission and values are founded on quality work, inclusive culture &amp; employee satisfaction. Our most valuable asset is _you_ and we aim to keep it that way. 

But don't let the midwest congeniality fool you; we appreciate strong opinions here and we want your input to help influence the way we work. This playbook is a living, breathing example of the opinions we hold and the strategies we use daily to reduce conflict and realize efficiency across our projects. 

There are some things we'll never fully align on... spaces or tabs? vim or not-vim? php or not-php? That's to be expected. Sometimes we deviate from convention based on client requirements or simply personal conviction. And while that can feel messy and it may well have an impact on our productivity or the maintainability of our code, its important to put your mark on the work we do. 

We don't have everything figured out but we do know that when we're intentional about something, it usually works out ok. When we put a stake in the ground only to realize later that we've made mistakes or we could do better, we're honest about that and accept responsibility. We celebrate our failures almost as often as our successes. And that is what makes Ample unique.  

So please consider submitting a PR to this project if/when you find an error or would like to contribute your creative solutions to the way we do work. All opinions matter here... except if you're using tabs b/c that shit is garbage.

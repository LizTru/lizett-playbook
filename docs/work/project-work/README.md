# How We Work

TODO: Overview ...

## How we communicate

We primarily use Slack for general communication.

- If you want to make sure everyone see's it this is your best bet (If your sick, you're locked out, etc.)
- For development questions use the [#developers](https://helloample.slack.com/messages/developer) channel following these [guidelines](https://helloample.slack.com/files/T02EJJ31Z/FRQDCCNEB?origin_team=T02EJJ31Z)
- Each project has it's own channel if it's a project specific question or update you can add it there
- Otherwise we are all friendly feel free to reach out wether it's a question, update or just to chat.

### Status/Standup

- We have a status meeting on Monday's to outline workloads for the week.
- For stand up we use the [#daily-standup](https://helloample.slack.com/archives/CD7LF9KQW) channel.
  - This is a quick meeting for everyone to outline what outline the work for today and if you have any blockers.
  - This can also a good time to let anyone else know important things like PR has comments/reviewed/ready.

## JAM Sessions

- @todo Dev & Design (pairing, decisions, questions, etc.)

### Paired Programming

We pair program a fair amount mainly centered around helping each other out.

- For remote it's really important to share your screen when talking through an issue.
- It can also be helpful (even if you're next to each other) to have a [VS Code Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) link. This allows for a more collaborative environment to work in since you can share editor and even the same local URL.

### Code Reviews

- @todo How to this can be somewhat project specific

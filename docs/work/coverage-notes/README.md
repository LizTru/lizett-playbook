# Introduction

When done correctly, coverage notes allow you to take the time you need off without resulting in any headaches for you or the team. In your coverage notes, you should provide 3 things: What you are currently working on, what the status of your work is, and any other important notes that might be helpful to someone picking up the task. In conjunction with coverage notes, you should also talk to your PM(s) about anything else you might have missed. Your coverage notes should then be posted in the #general channel on Slack

# Template

So long as you provide notes for the 3 pieces above, you are free to format the notes however you'd like. Below is an example ...

## Example

## Client Name

> Running Specs during the build

- Now that we have testing integrated into the Netlify build, we need to get the broken tests to pass.
- I would say I am 70% done, I just need to refactor a bit more.
  > Style issues
- The staging site needs to be password protected again. Previously there was an issue that was causing the styling to get messed up, Sean has provided a possible solution in the task notes.
- Downloading the Netlify CLI will allow you to test the password functionality locally
- I have only looked at this one briefly, estimate 1-2 hours.

## Client Name

> Port-346

- IXR expired content should be automatically hidden from view, currently, it is only being grayed out.
- I have a couple of hours left on this one.

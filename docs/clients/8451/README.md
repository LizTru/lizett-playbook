# 84.51°

This site is a Drupal site, hosted on Microsoft's [Azure App Service on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/containers/app-service-linux-intro). The 84.51° Drupal theme is built using [Particle](https://phase2.github.io/frontend-docs/).

The git repo is stored in [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/8451/8451-site/src/master/) and the README includes extensive notes on how to get up and running, locally, as well as steps to deploy the site (including pre-building the Particle theme).

- Pushes to the `master` branch will automatically deploy to [staging](https://stg.8451.com/)
- Pushes to the `production` branch will automatically deploy to [production](https://www.8451.com/)

Currently, both Taylor and Warren have access to the Bitbucket repo and the Azure Portal. Rodney Wilson at 84.51° is the person to grant access to these platforms. He is accessible via Ample's `#8451-support` Slack channel.

# Crossroads Church
## Who is Crossroads?
Crossroads is a church for people who don’t like church. They’re also the fastest growing church in the U.S. They say Crossroads is for anyone who wants to seek God—from those exploring whether or not God even exists, to committed Christ-followers. And that they present biblical truths and show how they apply to everyday lives. And they have a lot of fun while doing it. 

Crossroads focuses on their online community just as much as their in-person community and that is where we come in. Our job is to always help Crossroads improve the online experience for their users. We are here to make sure that the user can take in all that the church is putting out to the world, through live sermons, articles, videos, songs podcasts, and more.

## Technology
Crossroads.net and crossroads.net/media are built using Jekyll with their content coming from Contentful . We are also using stencil components through out there site on a repo named Crds-Components. We’re using crds-styles to share code across multiple repos. On some repos like net and media, crds-styles is installed as a submodule and other projects like components it is a NPM package. Crds-styles is built off of Bootstrap 3.4.1.

## Process
All tasks (features, defects, and spikes) for Crossroads developers are in Rally.
